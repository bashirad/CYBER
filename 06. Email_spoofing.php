						<h3> Reasons for email spoofing </h3>

					<b> Phishing </b> <br> 
					email spoofing is a gateway for phishing. 
					Pretending to be someone the recipient knows is a tactic to get 
					the person to click on malicious links or provide sensitive information. <p>
			
					<b> Identity theft </b> <br> Pretending to be someone else can help a 
					criminal gather more data on the victim (e.g. by asking for confidential 
					information from financial or medical institutions). <p>

					<b> Avoiding spam filters </b> <br> Frequent switching between email 
					addresses can help spammers avoid being blacklisted.		 <p>
